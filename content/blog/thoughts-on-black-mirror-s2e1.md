Title: Thoughts on Black Mirror S2E1
Date: 2021-09-02

Just watched _Black Mirror_ Season 2 Episode 1. There's a young couple Ash and
Martha. Ash dies suddenly, and Martha's grieving. Martha tries this AI service
which downloads Ash's public information and simulates him as a chatbot. Martha
enjoys talking to him (it) and gives him some private videos of Ashe so he can
simulate Ashe's voice so they can talk on the phone. Martha then orders the next
level of this service, which is a humanoid that looks like Ashe.

Something just clicked for me when I saw this. It was only around 15 minutes of
build-up, but suddenly I can really understand how this could be a thing. How you
can't really tell the difference between this sort of robot and an actual human.
How it doesn't really make sense to call humans sentient and conscious but not
call this sort of robot the same.
