Title: Curiosity or Duty
Date: 2021-09-05

There are many reasons to want to study aging:

1. one might prefer to live in a world where humans live longer and aren't forced to die
2. one might think it's their duty to help humans live longer
3. one might think aging is a very interesting problem to try to solve
4. one might think the biology related to aging is a very interesting thing to learn more about

Are these all good reasons? What are the benefits and downsides of each one?

The first two are morally motivated. A downside of this is you're more stressed
out; you think it's noble, important, necessary to solve the problem. Slacking off
or being distracted hurts you. Noticing yourself being more internally motivated
to do other things is a sign that you're immoral. This is terrible. The benefit
is that people with this motivation seem to be able to endure lots of pain when
working toward a problem; this seems to be important on harder problems like aging.

The last two are motivated by curiosity. Curiosity is awesome; it keeps you receptive
to new evidence and doesn't blind you to how the world really works, which can
happen if you're secretly hoping the world _is_ a certain way. Curiosity means you
really just want to know what the truth is, and you don't care too much what the
truth ends up being. This makes working _fun_, but the downside is that you only
go where curiosity leads you. You might not verify things that you're not curious
about. At least, that's what I originally thought. But if I was _really_ curious
about how things were, wouldn't I definitely notice when things didn't seem quite
right and be extra curious what was wrong? If I'm supremely curious, wouldn't I
_want to_ make sure I haven't made a misstep somewhere? I think so! And curiosity
doesn't mean I'll definitely get bored of a problem. If I'm insanely curious about
_how aging works_ and _how it might be reversed_, I bet I'd work on the problem
far longer and harder than if I was morally motivated which would just burn me
out eventually.

Am I willing to accept that choosing curiosity might make me stop working on aging
in a few years, when I find a new shiny problem to work on? Yes, I think I am. I
want to enjoy my life. I also don't think this is very likely though! The longer
I work on something, the more curious I get about it. Everything is a universe unto
itself. If I work on this problem for my entire life, following my curiosity, and
I don't solve it, I still think that would be a good life. I'd be happy to have
had so much fun thinking and poking around and learning new things about how the
world works. How fun!
