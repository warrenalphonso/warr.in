Title: Studying Full-time
Date: 2023-02-09

I’ve got some savings and can stay unemployed for a while. I want to study AI.
How should I do this?

**The goal is to get as many hours of deliberate practice as possible over this
period.** Trust in the determinism of ten thousand hours.

What seems reasonable?

-   don’t do one project to completion at a time, making progress on several
    different tasks concurrently, work on different things based on interest and
    available energy
-   do different types of things. Two examples are reading textbooks and writing
    code. Split this up further and try different categorizations. The goal here is
    to work on a different type of task if I have fatigue from eg reading math
    textbooks. But track how each type of task is going so I know when things are
    going worse than expected
-   Try doing small periods of continuous work with serious reinforcing breaks in
    the middle like playing a _fun_ story-mode video game or doing deliberate
    basketball practice etc
-   Start small and ramp up. 2 hours a day is a good start. Note also how high
    quality the work is. Probably I can only do 2-3 hours of really high quality
    brain work. Rest of time coding or other kinds of easier work is okay! But have
    accurate measure of how much time you spend on each type!
