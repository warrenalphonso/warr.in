I played basketball with G today. I still feel a bit awkward and like I'm pretending
to be someone with more relatable interests like travel or cooking or restaurants.
It just comes off as even more unauthentic. Just be me. Get back into the things
I'm really interested in, like hardcode German and machine learning and biology
and Shakespeare and the Bible.

I need to hold myself to a higher standard of keeping streaks of productivity.
I keep saying I'm going to learn machine learning and I made a plan but I always
feel like I should get more work stuff done and never leave time for machine learning.
Remember that it should be priority number one. That's what actually matters, to
me and to the company if it pans out. My other skills aren't crucial.

Tonight, I'll do some German and machine learning to prime the pump. And wake up
at 6 AM tomorrow to get back on track. (Woah, don't order myself around so much
though... crack the whip and the worker part of me will rebel! So I'll do 30 minutes
of German and then read something since that's more fun than staring at a computer
for 1 hour.)
