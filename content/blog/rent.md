Title: Sadly, Rent

Bryne Hobart asks ["How many trillion-dollar companies should there be?"](https://www.thediff.co/archive/how-many-trillion-dollar-companies-should-there-be/#how-many-trillion-dollar-companies-should-there-be)
Market cap is functionally humanity's best guess at expected total dividends returned to
shareholders. A company's profits come from its revenue, and its revenue comes
from how much entities (probably mostly consumers) pay for its services. A trillion
dollar company is one that pays out at least a trillion dollars to its shareholders,
so its revenues must be over a trillion dollars, so it must be providing more than
a trillion dollars of value to consumers.

There are 6 trillion dollar companies today: Apple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Alphabet, Amazon,
and Nvidia. Microsoft currently pays out $0.75 per share per quarter. It has 7.5
billion outstanding shares, so that's about $20B in dividends per year. It's
worth $3T so humanity expects 150 years of current earnings to persist.

Value provided to consumers isn't all that matters though! The light bulb and
electricity provided much more value than Microsoft did, but its inventors didn't
become quadrillionaires. *Capturing* some portion of that value is critical!

Bryne says you need some sort of runaway network effect. He summarizes it as:
when the thing you figured out first eventually becomes obvious to everyone else,
have you set up a system that ensures that you're still accumulating new and
valuable secrets faster than anyone else?

- Facebook and Apple leverage the in-network effect (if your friends are on it,
  you won't try anything else).
- Tiktok also does this but it's less social. They use user data to make the app
  much better for the user and marginally better for everyone else. Making it
  better for everyone else means you don't try other apps
- Amazon does this with improving its deliverability speed to crazy levels with
  insights on user location
- I don't think AWS and Azure have unstoppable network effects? They just have economies
  of scale.
- Microsoft Office (Microsoft's biggest revenue stream) just uses proprietary
  software network effects. I don't think this has unstoppable network effects?
- Saudi Arabia doesn't have network effects. They just lucked into one of the
  largest crude oil reserves happening to exist under their ancestral lands, so they win.

This is a form of *economic rent*. These firms have found a "natural resource"
(some tool that's amenable to unstoppable network effects) and charge as much as
they can for it. Their profits can't be competed away, so they get to capture lots
of the value they create. It's a rent in the [Georgian sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism):
owners extracting more value out of a scarce resource than they "deserve" based on
the resources expended in creating/improving it.
(Thanks to [Lars Doucet and Scott Alexander for making the connection to
Georgism](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-billionaire).)

So I wonder: is this worth thinking about before eg starting a company? Is being
satisfied with producing lots of value for society foolish because you're missing
opportunities to charge rent?

One approach is to *embrace* the inevitability of your profits being competed
away. Suppose you think ultrasound neuromodulation devices should be much better
than they currently are. You can go build the first really good product, charge
a lot for it until competitors crop up to eat away at your margins, and then
leave satisfied. You wanted, after all, better devices and now there's a healthy
competition pushing the state-of-the-art!

Well, but you are still leaving money on the table by not finding a way to
monopolize your advantage. Suppose there's an innovation in neuromodulation
that costs $100B to realize. If your profits are eaten up before you can invest
$100B, this innovation will never be realized! The system is
broken and doesn't regulate rents, so it feels irrational to just ignore that
inefficiency...

[Vamshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vamshibalanaga/) pointed out that the greatest
inventions don't seem to come about from immense investment by a few firms; they're
usually the result of some genius working for very little because he can't help
himself. [Matt Clancy points out](https://mattsclancy.substack.com/p/how-common-is-independent-discovery)
that rediscovery is likely if the idea seems important looking
forward; it's cause areas and ideas that are only important in retrospect that
aren't likely to be independenly rediscovered. That's good news since even the
most ambitious companies probably can't justify entirely pie-in-the-sky research.

Also, *is* the economy that competitive? We only have ten billion people who can
compete, and probably less than half of them have direct access to the global
economy. There are all sorts of inefficiencies that wouldn't exist in a world with
100 trillion people.
