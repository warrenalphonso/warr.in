Title: Romance and Maslow's Hierarchy
Date: 2022-11-01

A successful relationship requires either:

-   you’re low on Maslow’s hierarchy (lots of menial tasks to do, not much free
    time or slack in life)
-   each partner is the other’s top priority, even above children

Without fulfilled Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s easy to not care so much about the
quality of the relationship and focus on securing base needs by cooperating. Once
you have those, cooperation isn’t so important and there’s slack in the system
to pursue other pleasures, so the relationship quality needs to be high.

If you’re not each other’s top priority, that can work for a while, until the top
priority isn’t aligned with the relationship anymore. For example, typically
children will be the top priority. But once they’re grown, the couple can quickly
grow distant and the relationship can deteriorate. If couples had the choice to
separate or pick new partners (without any of the societal/religious consequences
of divorce), they probably would.

Another example is if both people are really dedicated to a company or cause. Easy
to cooperate on life things so you can both spend lots of time on it. But once
there’s a slight misalignment on that goal, it’s very easy to want to split.

Making each other _top_ priority means that enriching the relationship is the number
one thing you want to be thinking about and cooperating on. The relationship is
finally an ends unto itself. That seems like the only stable relationship
configuration…
