Title: Loneliness After Moving
Date: 2021-08-01

I recently moved to a new country for my first job after college. When I got here,
I was hit by the biggest wave of isolation I’ve ever felt. The people here are
nice and my living arrangements are set and my job looks great, but I couldn't
shake the feeling of not belonging here. I miss my family and friends tremendously.
When I was with them though, I enjoyed their company and felt at ease, but I still
often preferred to read a book away from everyone or got bored of taking so many
pictures with them. Why do I feel so strongly that I’d rather be back there,
living at home with them, much more than I’d prefer to work or be by myself?
I know that wouldn't make me happy long-term, but I still feel very lonely and
homesick.

I’ve met a lot of people here, too. I can message any of them right now to hang
out, and they would probably say yes and it would probably make me feel better,
but I don't think that's right. I don't want to reach for someone else to fix my
loneliness. I don't typically feel this lonely when I’m on my own, so I want to
figure out what's so different now. I have a hunch I’m misinterpreting something
basic, that I’m not understanding on a gut level something I logically know to be
true.

Loneliness means I’m not connecting much with other people. Whenever I was talking
to the people I met, sometimes even for more than an hour, I’ve felt pretty happy.
I don't think that happiness comes from me not being lonely anymore; rather, it comes
from me being too busy or caught up in thinking about the conversation that I
don't have time to let my loneliness fester. I’m distracted by the conversation.

Afterward, I always feel like the conversation wasn't that great. Like it was
superficial and the person didn't like me and the person doesn't really have much
in common with me and I don't see them as a potential close friend. What's funny
is that I almost never have very deep or insightful conversations with my family or
friends! Why am I setting the bar so high for the people I’ve just met? (I think
I’m close to the problem now.) Loneliness isn't just about being with or talking
to people; it's about connecting with them. I haven't let myself appreciate how
connected I’ve gotten to people here. I even had a long, very insightful conversation
with someone who's very much like me. We both seemed to like talking to each other.
And yet, I noticed that since that conversation, I’ve sort of written him off as
not interesting and not that fun.

I think part of the reason I’m getting a bad taste in my mouth after talking to
people I don't know one-on-one is that I’m trying too hard. Trying too hard to
figure out what kind of person they think is interesting. Trying too hard to avoid
awkward silences. Trying too hard to laugh at the right times and keep the
conversation at a fun pace. Hm. Actually, I don't know if that's really the
reason. It doesn't _quite_ feel right.

Let me try zooming out to how I used to be with other people. Back home and in
college, I was really happy when working on a tough problem or going on a walk.
I would have small conversations with people living near me (my parents and sister
at home, people in my dorm at college), but I only went out to hang out with people
about once a week. I remember before college classes started, I was pretty busy
but if I think about it now, I can imagine that if I wasn't so busy I probably
would have felt pretty lonely. Has it always been "busyness" that kept me from
feeling lonely when I'm in a new environment? When I think of my parents, they
rarely see other people. They like to come home after work and get back to their
normal routine (cleaning, watching the news, playing with the dog, praying). Maybe
that's it all along.

This isn't an answer I’m happy with. If I suddenly had nothing to do, I don't want
to be crushed by loneliness. Knowing this, I might try to find things to do just
to keep myself from feeling lonely. I wish I could feel more connected to the
people I already know.

One perspective shift that might be useful is to think of the calls to friends
and family back home or around the world as a privilege instead of feeling terrible
that I can't be with them. Be grateful that phones exist and they're free and
willing to talk to me. That they're giving up some of their infinitely valuable
time to talk to me. Wow, how incredibly lucky I am!

Another perspective shift that won't be so easy is to think of myself as more
connected to people, in general. I logically believe very strongly that human lives
are unbelievably important and precious, that we're all capable of immense depth
of emotion and experience, that making people's experience of consciousness better
is a terminal goal. In _HPMOR_, Harry seems very connected with _humanity as a whole_
even though he doesn't talk to the other children all that much. He has a very
clear picture of humanity's potential and value, and he draws a lot of strength
from holding onto the picture. I also want to do that.

Even after a full day of being with and talking with people at work, on the walk
to buy groceries and home, I felt the same dull constant pang of loneliness.
Something's wrong. I still think I'm mostly _distracted_ when I'm with other
people, and once that distraction goes away I can notice the loneliness again.
I'm the most _free_ I've ever been and also the most crippled by loneliness I've
ever been. I need to spend more time solving this. I'll start with meditation.

Another thing. Whenever I have to do something new or not something I would do
on automatic, I become less confident, and I feel more of a "that's it, I'm
inevitably going to fail to do this eventually and die." I mean for the simplest
things, like remembering to tear up papers with my personal information and put
them in compost. Or asking a shop attendant who only speaks German where the salt
is instead of just not buying some. Or buying groceries I don't usually buy to try
them out. I wish those things out of my comfort zone excited me, gave me more
fuel, made me appreciate my life more here. But they do the opposite.
