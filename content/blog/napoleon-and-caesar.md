Title: Napoleon and Caesar
Date: 2021-06-14

Yesterday, I visited the British Museum. They've got a large room with exhibits
on the Enlightenment. The walls of the room are lined with bookshelves from
(I think) King George III's library. I happened across two books by Napoleon:

I had previously read that Napoleon held Caesar in high regard, and that when
someone compared him to Caesar he broke down and felt his life had come full circle.

But I had always imagined that he only read about Caesar or took notes every now
and then. Actually, Napoleon actually took the time to write at least two whole
books on his idol. Napoleon who was the most important man in France for a few
decades and always at war thought it important to sit and write books.

It’s not that important and busy people don’t often write books. It’s more that
I’ve imagined someone like Napoleon as singularly focused on whatever he’s most
known for. But increasingly, I find that many historical figures actually have
done a lot of other things with their lives. Not that they were or tried to be
jack-of-all-trades, but that they seemed to just do things that seemed interesting,
instead of weighing as much as I do whether that thing is worth pursuing. How
wonderful that the optimal strategy to changing the world (not that I or other
people should want to change the world for its own sake) is to live a full life.

Napoleon also wrote a lot of letters. He must have written almost everyday, though
I doubt that was uncommon for a military commander.
