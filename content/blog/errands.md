Title: Errands
Date: 2022-01-07

I realized I really like running small errands throughout my work day. At first,
I thought it was about distracting myself; doing the dishes or getting the mail
or buying groceries were a way to focus on something mindless instead of think
hard about something else. But I don't think that's it anymore. I think it's way
simpler: I enjoy moving around a bit and looking at different things because most
of my work day is spent looking at a computer.
