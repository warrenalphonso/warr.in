I'd like to work meaningfully on helping people live longer and healthier. I keep
falling into moods of "I'm not very smart,
someone's probably already tried all the ideas I could come up with". Trying to
figure out how efficient different
parts of the world are is hard but important when deciding what to work on. But I
_don't need to pay attention to this hard-to-read signal; I can just look at what
people have tried!_

#### Keeping up with current research

There are lots of papers published everyday. What does keeping up with this look
like? Here are some ideas:

-   read all articles on bioarxiv
-   replicate all articles on bioarxiv
-   update by gears-level models
-   read old important papers in the field
-   think about core ideas in each paper

The amount of reading that seems required is just really high. Reading fast isn't
my comparative advantage; can I avoid reading a lot? There are two things I could
do here.

##### Reduce number of papers I read

This means I need some way to filter papers. What properties should this filter
have?

-   likely to falsify my model
-   likely to be replicable
-   likely to impact other things I'm paying attention to

I could also use tools like Elicit and Google Scholar to decide what to read.

##### Reduce amount of time per paper

Some ideas:

-   an assistant to summarize papers
-   an assistant to read the paper and then explain just specific sections in context
    of the whole paper
-   get good at parsing "methods" section to find red flags
    -   can I find some "methodology reviews" or something to teach me what red flags
        to watch out for?
-   get good at looking at graphs to find where stuff smells of p-hacking or error-bar
    hacking
    -   I need to understand these two things in more depth then. That doesn't seem
        too hard.

#### Switching between breadth and depth

I shouldn't commit to just one of these as my "learning style". Depth-first is nice
when doing a project, but it's a terrible idea when mapping out a field. This might
not be a high-order bit though.

#### Making lots of beliefs that pay rent

A superpower here is understanding the epistemic state of the field:

-   reading history of biology, what were the biggest mistakes and what orientations
    prevent me from making the same mistakes if I were in that person's shoes?
-   read some blogs of people who point out epistemic problems in papers
-   find researchers with really high epistemic standards and figure out why the papers
    I'm reading are skipping some steps. How could skipping those steps prove fatal?
