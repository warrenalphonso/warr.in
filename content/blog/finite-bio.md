Title: Biology is easier
Date: 23-03-2023

Thinking a bit about AI research vs aging research (not that I have to choose one
or the other!) but it's interesting that biology research with AI helping us feels
like... a much easier problem than AI. Biology was designed by a blind idiot god
and is _done_ and set in stone and we know it works. Intelligence isn't. That's
entirely alien. Who knows how many levels of new-ness there are above us?
