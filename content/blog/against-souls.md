Title: Against the Existence of Souls
Date: 2021-06-06

Many religions advocate the existence of some sort of afterlife. Usually, this
promise of an eternal paradise is used to persuade followers to stick to the
church's rules, to please its deities, or to serve its leaders. Even if doing so
is awkward or morally questionable or even dangerous, it's hard to decide that it
isn't worth it _if_ you believe in an afterlife.

It took me a long time to abandon my agnosticism. Aside from the seemingly contradictory
way the world worked (seriously, _why_ does evil _need_ to exist; why didn't the
Christian God just think up a better solution than actively killing so many people
in the Bible; evolution is almost certainly true, so why are creation stories so
wrong), I couldn't fully convince myself of atheism. The following isn't anything
close to a _proof_ that souls don't exist; there's always a way to define souls
or the afterlife to weasel out of the implications of the given argument. But
given how I (and I think most people) imagine souls working, it's hard to go back
to honestly _expecting_ an afterlife to exist.

## What's a soul?

The core assumption we'll make is that the soul is what _thinks_. I've got an
internal monologue yapping for most of the day so that's the idea that comes to
mind when I imagine "thinking". If it exists, my soul is what's behind that.

This is the point where most theists protest that it's your brain that does the
thinking; your soul, they'll claim, is the _essence_ of you. I've heard this in
several different, wise-sounding phrasings, but I think this is a nonsensical claim.
What else can even _be_ you, if not the thoughts you think? Without those, you
have no identity, you can't process information, you can't pray, you can't make
decisions, you can't be happy, you can't rejoice in Heaven or suffer in Hell,
you can't _do_ anything!

Another common objection is that when you die, another thinking-complex takes
over; or maybe while you're alive, your brain thinks, but when you die, your
soul takes over and does the thinking. This also doesn't make much sense: if
there's no continuation of self, why is the thing that wakes up after dying
still _you_?

Ultimately, if there is to be a continuous experience of consciousness, if the
same _you_ that lives now will experience the afterlife, then an immortal soul
_must_ be the source of your thoughts.

## Thought experiment

Suppose I hand you a box. It's pretty heavy, and when you talk to it, you're
surprised to find out that it talks back! What's more, it seems to be able to
reason, understand humor, and express emotions. In the middle of asking it how
its day has been, you accidentally drop the box, nicking one of the corners. When
the box answers, you're caught off guard with the previously-polite box's sudden
use of profanity: "My fucking day's been really shitty actually, fuck you."

Damaging the box in other ways seems to cause other unexpected changes in its
responses: the box might start st-st-stuttering after every other word, or fail
to produce semantically correct sentences while getting the tone of the expected
response completely right, or lose the ability to understand or make jokes, or
immediately forget about the responses it's already given. In fact, when you're
given other boxes, you find that particular kinds of damage cause the same sort
of result in the way the box responds.

How would you expect the box works? At a basic level, do you think there's a
microphone inside the box and someone is relaying answers from outside the box?
Or do you think the structure that's _doing the thinking_ is inside the box?

## Conclusion

It seems very likely that the thing doing the thinking must be inside the box,
because the types of changes to the box's responses are changes to the way _it thinks_.
When we damage the box, we change the way the box's responses are put together;
indeed, it seems even the thoughts the box _can_ think are affected by the type
of physical damage. Simply damaging an internal mic wouldn't cause those same
sorts of changes.

The analogy here is that the box is the human body, and the damage that's being
done is brain damage. If souls existed, we wouldn't _expect_ physical damage to
_change the sort of thoughts we can think_.

This argument isn't one I came up with myself; I came across it [in this comment
thread](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/siFaJYuPDNLCGz2b6/hp-mor-and-the-radio-fallacy?commentId=gDEbic9DCtq2w44ud).
What struck me was that the idea of brain damage is so commonly known, and yet
so obviously antagonistic to the idea of souls. I hadn't ever been _surprised_
that brain damage existed, even though its existence implied the non-existence of
souls, which I truly believed in. Maybe that's because I sort of classified souls
as non-physical and thereby unfalsifiable, or maybe I never thought about souls
hard enough to really think about what I _expected_ that belief to _look like_
in the real world.

My grandmother recently passed. We've still got her picture up by the altar in our
living room. She's had dementia for as long as I can remember. I didn't get to
spend much time with her, because we live halfway around the world from her. Even
when we did visit (at most once every 2 years), I didn't really look forward to
spending time with her; she was always pleasant to be around, but it was too sad
to see how reproducible her questions and responses became. Every day, during our
family rosary, my Dad will pray for her soul. He genuinely loved his Mom, and she
him from the stories he's told me. But whenever he says a prayer for her, I wonder
what he _expects_ to see in Heaven: will he see his Mom when she was younger and
could think and reason without dementia hammering at her thoughts? If that's my
_real_ Grandma, who was the person I got to know?

What unfathomable evils brain damage and death are.
