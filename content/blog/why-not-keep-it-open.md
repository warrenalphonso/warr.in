Title: Why Not Keep It Open?
Date: 2022-02-09

Just jotting down a lot of things that I thought about during my walk today after
I saw a pretty girl:

-   I feel sexually attracted to some people. That's a Fact about what I physically
    feel. If I'm in a monogamous relationship, I have to either lie about feeling
    sexually attracted to anyone else, or admit the attraction but commit to not
    acting on it.
-   The former is bad: I'm lying about something that's True.
-   The latter doesn't feel right either because the reason seems hollow. Why
    shouldn't I act on the attraction? "Because sex is a purely romantic thing and
    having sex with someone else means I don't value my current partner romantically,
    or not as much as if I only wanted to have sex with her?" Why should sex be
    purely romantic? Why can't I be entirely devoted to someone and still act on my
    evolutionarily-ingrained desire to have sex with an attractive person? And it
    doesn't feel right that sex should be mostly romantic either: does more sex mean
    there's more romance? That's not right... And what the hell even is romance? I
    care mostly about a very deep connection and care for the other person in a
    relationship. That can happen with zero sex.
-   I also feel like this desire to monogamy stems from anxiety of being cuckolded.
    Like that's so terrible so let's promise to not let that happen so we can be
    entirely devoted. But DNA tests now exist! The cuckold thing is mostly about how
    other people will see you; not that you're (consciously) personally horrified at
    the prospect of raising someone else's child.
-   And also at least some part of sex is a physical thing. Your body wants to have
    sex because otherwise it wouldn't exist. Not having to hide that would feel much
    better than hiding it.
-   I feel like it sounds like I'm saying "monogamy is hard so I don't want to do
    it." Not really; some hard things are worth doing. It's more that I think
    monogamy is antithetical to the values I want from a relationship.
